Decentralized Supply chain management Smart Contract
========================================================

Due to the presence of multiple participants and tiers in the supply chain network there lies a high risk of data corruption and authenticity, resulting in lack of data transparency and responsiveness. However, there are several methods that are being practiced to establish more secure supply chain networks. The emergence of block-chain technology has created several paths for potential innovations in business industries making the management easier. Therefore combining traditional supply chain services with the block-chain technologies can help create an efficient supply chain management network. In this project, we have proposed an idea of ‘Decentralized Supply Chain Management Smart Contract Using Block-chain’ which is a small step of making the supply chain a trust-worthy network. We proposed a block-chain based framework with the use of associated technology, i.e. Smart contracts, to experience the practical application of supply chain process design. The Smart contract is designed to ease the management, in which the manufacturer provides complete details of the products, while the consumer has the real time access to details of products and status of transaction. Details of each product is a non-fungible token which ensures that the data is immutable.




**I. INTRODUCTION**



The primary purpose of the research is to withdraw the
problem of traceability, authenticity and transparency
involved in traditional supply chain management. Due to the
presence of multiple stakeholders the supply chain network
becomes complex. To make an effective supply chain it is
required to integrate these steps and the stakeholders. The
involvement of numerous intermediaries raises several
challenges in the management of the supply chain. Over the
past decade consumers are more driven towards a system that
is transparent and reliable. In today’s era where the ecological
and ethical base of goods holds a larger share in consumption
rate, it is essential to investigate the unlawful activities of a
stakeholder in the supply chain.
Over the period in the traditional supply chain system, the
data is mostly recorded by individual firms in a centralized
ledger that has been locally stored. When the information on
the ledger is not in favor of the development of the firm itself,
it may be forged privately. As a result, distrust between firms
has become increasingly prominent, resulting in an increase
in communication costs. Moreover, due to the high
probability of tampering with data within the firm, the
information between the supply chain nodes is uncertain,
which leads to an interrupted product traceability process.
However, the advent of Bitcoin has brought a hi-tech avenue
to solve the arising problems, and with its hidden technology
block-chain has been quickly recognized by all spheres of
life. In the year 1991, the term “Block-chain” was
conceptually introduced by Stuart Haber and W.Journal of
Cryptology, which gave a detailed account on the concept of
blocks that are chained together and secured with encryption
(Gabriel et al. 2019). This distributed ledger technology holds
very significant features of decentralization, traceability,
Tamper-proofing, and cryptographic security.
Since Bitcoin is designed only for digital currency scenarios,
many other Block-chain based systems have turned up and
various applications have been represented on the Blockchain in the form of ‘‘smart contracts’’. Ethereum first
released the entire fit of Block-chain and smart contracts, in
2015. The Ethereum smart contract is written as a stack-based
low-level byte-code language, which is carried out by
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is called EVM code
(Westerkamp et al. 2018,). Smart contracts can also be built
using high-level languages, such as Solidity and then
compiled into EVM code.

In this project, we will be developing a smart contract in
Ethereum Solidity for Decentralized Supply Chain
Management (DSCM). This Smart contract would enhance
the traceability, authenticity and transparency in traditional
supply chains.
